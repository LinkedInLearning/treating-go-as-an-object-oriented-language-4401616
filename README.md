Did you know that treating Go like an object-oriented programming language can allow you to create more functional and more powerful behavior? Join instructor Frank P Moley III in this hands-on, interactive course to practice advancing your skills in Go, the popular, statically typed programming language. This course includes Code Challenges powered by CoderPad. Code Challenges are interactive coding exercises with real-time feedback, so you can get hands-on coding practice to advance your coding skills. Frank helps you boost your skills as a Go programmer with specific, coding challenges that treat Go like an object-oriented language. Practice creating and working with structs, synthesizing classes, and leveraging encapsulation, composition, and polymorphism, building object-oriented behavior as you go.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"

## Installing
1. To use these exercise files, you must have the following installed:
	- Go SDK version 1.20 or greater installed
2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like SourceTree.
